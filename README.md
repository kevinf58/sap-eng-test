# Implementation Explanation

For my frontend, I used breakpoints, and VW and VH units for creating a responsive UI.
For reusability, I created a common folder that included components that would be commonly used throughout the app. Other components not in the common folder were seperated for modularity.

A types folder exists to organize and reuse all types needed throughout my app

Lastly, for my HTTP requests, I used axios and inserted the functions directly into wherever it was needed. Though a seperated folder called something like "services" to organize my api calls would have probably been a better choice.
